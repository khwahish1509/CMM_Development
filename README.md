## What is a CMM?
A **Coordinate Measuring Machine** is a high-precision tool used to:

- Measure physical objects against design specifications.
- Verify tolerances and quality in manufacturing.

### Types of CMMs:
- **Bridge CMM**: High precision for lab use.
- **Cantilever CMM**: Ideal for smaller parts.
- **Gantry CMM**: For large objects.
- **Portable CMM**: Handheld for on-site measurements.

## Core Functions of a CMM
- **Measuring Geometries:** Dimensions, angles, and shapes.
- **Inspecting Tolerances:** Verifying that parts meet acceptable variation limits.
- **Generating Reports:** For quality assurance and client review.

## Key Components of a CMM

### 1. **Probes**
- **Touch Probes:** Physically contact surfaces to measure.
- **Laser Probes:** Use lasers for non-contact measurements.
- **Vision Systems:** Cameras for fragile or small parts.

### 2. **Axes**
- Operate on 3 or 5 axes (X, Y, Z, and rotations).

### 3. **Controller**
- A computer system that operates the CMM and processes measurement data.
