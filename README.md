## 📋 Workflow for CMM Operations

### 1. **Setup**
- 🔧 Align the part to a reference point (datum).
- 📏 Calibrate the probe for accurate measurements.

### 2. **Programming**
- 💻 Use software like **PC-DMIS**, **Calypso**, or **PolyWorks** to define measurement paths.

### 3. **Measurement**
- 📊 Collect data points via touch or scanning probes.

### 4. **Data Analysis**
- 🧐 Compare data to blueprints and identify deviations.

### 5. **Report Generation**
- 📝 Compile and analyze data for quality control.
